# ClickBox

The website was designed to be an interactive speaker. The idea of the design was created throught a thought process which stated; speakers used to 
be interactive objects that needed physical inetraction in order to change setting. This means, buttons (pause/start, next/previous, choose a song, etc.) 
However, nowadays, speakers are just objects that can be fully controlled by a device connected to it. This means there is no longer any physical 
interaction with speakers other than the on/off switch. Building something that is able to fully function through the physical touch is something I enjoy 
doing, as I see meaning in it. This is why I wanted to make my own User Interface (UI). I wanted to show that a user doesn't need to gain knowledge from 
a website. I wanted to show that a website could simply be for enjoyment and entertainment. At current times, we all live at 1000KPH, and sometimes it is 
okay just to sit back, relax, and mess around with something with no real end goal. This point in time, where everyone is to stay at home, and do nothing 
all day is a great time so create a website that allows people to relax and have fun. 

In order to come up with this idea, two things were combined, my love for music and minimalistic designs. I spend a lot of time listening to music as it is very 
important to me, as well as when I was younger I always enjoyed interactive websites that are made to satisfy the user with visuals and interaction. 
This project/website could be used for someone who just wants a different and unique speaker to play their music, or for someone to play around and enjoy. 
 
## UX
 
This website is something to satisfy a users needs (in a simplistic way). I wanted to capture that speaker interactivity with this website, which is now lost in
the real life. There is no real point and goal that you get out of the use of this website. Thus, what it does give, is a simplistic outlook and idea which can be used 
at anyone's own liking. This website is a music player with a an interactive UI design and approach.

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Music player - allows tghe user to listen to a playlist of songs see how long left. (only 4 used now*) 

- Music timer - allows the user to see how long is left in the song.

- Buttons/Switches - Allows the user to alter the current page or color of all the items on screen.

- Multi layered - allows the user to view and interact multiple screens and views without scrolling or having to load another page. 

- Volume Slider - allows the user to lower or increase the volume levels of the music player.

- Clock - allows the users own time to be displayed on the screen. 

- Tutorial - helps the user to know what to click when the page is loaded.

- Mute button - allows the user to compleatly mute the audio with a simple click and 

- Color Switching - allows the user to alter the colors of the nearly each div/button of the whole website. 
### Features Left to Implement

- Shuffle button - This would allow the user to suffle the list of music to change up the experience.

- Music upload - This would allow the user to upload their own music and listen to it. Originally i was planning on adding this feature but as the time limit came up
i decided it would be better to work on the rest of the project before i ran out of time. I really wanted this feature to be added because i wanted the user to be
able to have their own music and not have it just be my own choice, as everyone has different taste in music.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML] - to create the framework of my website.
- [CSS] - to design the look of the website and colors.
- [Javascript] - to change the website layout for the user.
- [Jquery] - to change the layout of the website.
- [Font-awsome](http://fontawesome.com/)
- [fonts.googleapis] (https://fonts.google.com/)

## Testing

I tested my website on multiple different screen sizes to make sure it all fits well together. However I stuck more to the larger computer screen size.
This is because most people just use an apps on their phones for their music. 

I had some issues with speaker sizing for mobile versions because of the thin width of the phone and the speaker being more "Thic". The aspect ratio of the top view of the speaker never changes
which is great however this cant be said the same about the speaker shape when "zoomed out".

Lots of time went into testing how the Speaker screen works with the Javascript and using -hideClass/addClass- or .attr. I spent alot of time with the wesbite open to click and
check that every button works and sends the right request from the buttons to the items. I wanted the HTML to be very simple while the CSS and JavaScript did all the work of the website. 
Most Divs have mulitple classes to show and hide them or even change how they look to give the idea that the user is interacting with a device through a device. 



## Deployment

# ClickBox

What this website is an interactive speaker. I came up with this idea because i thought, speakers used to be things u pysicly interact with (screen/buttons/etc..) 
However now speakers are just a thing you connect your phone with and use through there. I love building somthing that functions like an engine/legos/buildings.
this was why i wanted to make my own User Interface. I wanted to show that a website alway have to give the user information or anything. At times like this 
we all live at 1000KPH sometimes it okay just to sit back and mess around with somthing with no real end goal. Plus what better time to make a pointless thing
to pass the time then during this lockdown right?? To come up with this project I combined two things I like, Music and Minamalistic designs. I spend a lot of 
time listening to music because it is quite important to me and when i was younger I always enjoyed interactive websites that are just made for no point but to 
satisfy the user with visuals and satisfying clicks. This project/website could be used for someone who just wants a background on their laptop while they play 
music or just for someone to mess around with. 
 
## UX
 
This website is something to satisfy a users need (in a simplistice way). i wanted to capture that speaker interactivity with this website. That this website is.
There is no real point and goal that you get out of the use of this website. But what it does give is a simplitice look and background to use your own personal
background. This website is a music player with a twist and also a show at a interactive UI design.

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Music player - allows tghe user to listen to a playlist of songs see how long left. (only 4 used now*) 

- music timer - allows the user to see how long is left in the song.

- Buttons/Switches - Allows the user to alter the current page or color of all the items on screen.

- Multi layered - allows the user to view and interact multiple screens and views without scrolling or having to load another page. 

- Volume Slider - allows the user to lower or increase the volume levels of the music player.

- Clock - allows the users own time to be displayed on the screen. 

- tutorial - helps the user to know what to click when the page is loaded.

- mute button - allows the user to compleatly mute the audio with a simple click and 

- color switching - allows the user to alter the colors of the nearly each div/button of the whole website. 
### Features Left to Implement

- Shuffle button - This would allow the user to suffle the list of music to change up the experience.

- music upload - This would allow the user to upload their own music and listen to it. organaly i was planning on adding this feature but as the time limit came up
i decided it would be better to work on the rest of the project before i ran out of time. I really wanted this feature to be added because i wanted the user to be
able to have their own music and not have it just be my own choice, as everyone has different taste in music.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML] - to create the framework of my website.
- [CSS] - to design the look of the website and colors.
- [Javascript] - to change the website layout for the user.
- [Jquery] - to change the layout of the website.
- [Font-awsome](http://fontawesome.com/)
- [fonts.googleapis] (https://fonts.google.com/)

## Testing

I had tested my website on different screen sizes to make sure it all fits well together whatever device the user is using. however i stuck more to the largr computer screen size.
This is because most people just use apps for their music on phones. 

I had some issues with speaker sizing for mobile versions because of the thin width and the speaker being more "Thic". The aspect ratio of the top view of the speaker never changes
which is great however this cant be said the same about the speaker shape when "zoomed out".

Lots of time went into testing how the Speaker screen works itself with the Javascript and using -hideClass/addClass- or .attr. I spent alot of timw with the wesbite open to click and
check that every button works and sents the right request from the buttons to the items. I wanted the HTML to be very simple white the CSS and JavaScript did all the work of the website. 
so most Divs have mulitple classes to show and hide them or even change how they look to give the idea that the user is interacting with a device through a device. 

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
